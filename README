Simple telnet client/server
===========================

Run the server as:

    ./server

It requires port 5555 to be open (this can be changed in mt.h, 
or make it a command line parameter if you wish).

To run clients, run

    ./client2 127.0.0.1

To connect locally, as the server listens locally.

It's hackish, and the code isn't pretty, but it works mildly
well.
